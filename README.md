ðŸŒ±	 Maintaining soil health is imperative for farmers to increase crop productivity and profitability while improving the environment

ðŸŒ±	How do we find the most optimal treatment for improving soil health? 

ðŸŒ±	Will maximizing soil health increase crop yield? 

ðŸŒ±	The Morton National Wind Erosion Research Network site is managed by the USDA Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL) and is part of the Long Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) network

ðŸŒ±	The Soil Conservation District has provided land for NGPRL scientists to address production and environmental problems associated with dryland cropping systems

ðŸŒ±  Dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/data-from-crop-and-weather-dependent-yield-and-wind-erosion-benefits-from-a-conservation-p
ðŸŒ±  This dataset has two type of treatments: Aspirational and Business as Usual. 

ðŸŒ± Aspirational: 
Planting cash crops directly into the terminated cover crop without plowing or tilling the soil
Leaves straw in field
Cover crops include grasses and legumes to increase soil health and decrease soil erosion

ðŸŒ± Business as usual:
Removal of wheat straw after harvest leaving the soil bare and exposed 
No cover crop: soil is left bare between planting seasons

ðŸŒ± This project conducts Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on agronomic and environmental variables to uncover latent factors influencing
crop performance, and performs MANOVA to reveal the the effect of treatment latent agronomic-environmental performance patterns varied by crop
type. 

ðŸŒ± Lastly, we will deliver actionable insights for sustainable farming practices by aligning treatment efficacy with environmental responses, and an automated preprocessing, modeling, and visualization pipeline in R and Python for reproducible analysis of agricultural data.
